mhPaint is a basic pixel art drawing application with various tools and a simplistic interface written in the Java programming language.

Such tools being:
1. Paintbrush
2. PaintBucket
3. Eraser Tool
4. Clear Grid Tool
5. Custom Colors
6. and much more to come

The program has saving functionality for .bmp files and will support loading functionality in the near future.

Its general performance is rather weak, relying on the built in Swing library in Java for the individual grid-blocks ("pixels") which causes a notable lack of snappiness
that would be expected for such a simple application.

Being written in the Java programming language is has the possibility of being deployed on any JVM supporting platform, assuming that it has the required power in order to
run the application.
